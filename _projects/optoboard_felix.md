This project is a part of the [Optoboard System project](/projects/optoboard_system) but became big enough to showcase it in its own project.

The aggregation in the ITk Pixel Detector data transmission chain is performed by the low-power Gigabit Transceiver (lpGBT) chip, controllable through I2C or optical link.

I designed and developed the control software (including a GUI) $$\texttt{optoboard_felix}$$ to enable users to carry out fast configuration for hundreds of registers and perform testing routines, such as bit error rate tests, for commissioning of the data transmission chain.

Its backend is now part of the online software $$\texttt{DeMi}$$ [[1](https://demi.docs.cern.ch/)] for the ITk Pixel and Strips system tests.
All of these software developments will form the basis for rapid and reliable operations during collisions.
