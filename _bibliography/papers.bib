  abstract = {The LHC and its experiments at CERN constitute the largest particle physics research programme to date, allowing for extensive studies of the existing Standard Model (SM) and for potential evidence of physics beyond that of our current comprehension.
This thesis presents an analysis technique to find third generation Leptoquarks (LQ) in high mass \(\tau^+\tau^-\) final states.
The sensitivity on the coupling strength of a leptoquark with a chosen mass of 1.5 TeV (2 TeV) is \(g^2 = 6.61^{+1.13}_{-0.95}\) (\(g^2 = 10.98^{+1.92}_{-1.65}\)).
This is calculated using the total transverse mass of an event, \(m_{T}^{\text{total}}\).
In order to enhance the accuracy of tests on the Standard Model and to broaden the potential for uncovering new realms of physics such as leptoquarks, the LHC will be upgraded to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).
This thesis presents the development of the Optoboard System - the part of the ATLAS new Inner Tracker (ITk) Pixel Detector readout system that handles the transfer of data, command and trigger between the modules and the backend.
All ITk Pixel Detector modules are assigned and mapped to the Optoboard System with Twinax cables length between 3016 mm and 5776 mm.
Compatible with requirements in data transmission reliability, the Optoboard System is validated first with jitter measurements and bit error rate tests, reaching the desired \(BER_\text{95%} < 2.7 \times 10^{-12}\) and second, with Sr-90 radiation at the ITk Pixel system test site with the Outer Barrel (OB) demonstrator.}

  abstract   = {After Run III the ATLAS detector will undergo a series of upgrades to cope with the harsher radiation environment and increased number of proton interactions in the High Luminosity LHC. One of the key projects in this suite of upgrades is the ATLAS Inner Tracker (ITk). The pixel detector of the ITk must be read out accurately and with extremely high rate. The Optosystem performs electrical-to-optical conversion of signals from the pixel modules. We present a general overview on the design of the Optosystem and recent results related to the performance of the data transmission chain, pivoted on the Optoboards, and to the radiation hardness of the ASICs housed on it.},

  title     = {A facility for radiation hardness studies based on a medical cyclotron},
  journal   = {Journal of Instrumentation},
  abstract  = {The development of instrumentation for operation in high-radiation environments represents a challenge in various research fields, particularly in particle physics experiments and space missions, and drives an ever-increasing demand for irradiation facilities dedicated to radiation hardness studies. Depending on the application, different needs arise in terms of particle type, energy and dose rate. In this article, we present a versatile installation based on a medical cyclotron located at the Bern University Hospital (Inselspital), which is used as a controlled 18-MeV proton source. This accelerator is used for daily production of medical radioisotopes, as well as for multidisciplinary research, thanks to a 6.5-meter long beam transfer line that terminates in an independent bunker, dedicated only to scientific activities. The facility offers a wide range of proton fluxes, due to an adjustable beam current from approximately 10 pA to the micro-ampere range, together with a series of steering and focusing magnets along the beamline that allow for the beam spot to be focused down to a few mm\(^2\). The beamline can be instrumented with a variety of beam monitoring detectors, collimators, and beam current measurement devices to precisely control the irradiation conditions.  The facility also hosts a well equipped laboratory dedicated to the characterisation of samples after irradiation. An experimental validation of the irradiation setup, with proton fluxes ranging from \(5 \times 10^9 cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) to \(4 \times 10^{11} cm^{-2}s^{-1}\), is reported.}
