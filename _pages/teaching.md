## Modeling Techniques in Physics
- taught 2022 and 2021

Four part lecture series with focus on Monte Carlo methods, a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to provide approximate solutions to a variety of mathematical and physical problems. Main features of random number generators will be introduced and most common sampling techniques will be discussed. Then some example of how Monte Carlo simulations are used for the modelling of physical processes will be given. I was responsible for all Monte Carlo exercise classes providing help on code development and physics/statistics questions.

## Introduction to Programming and Computational Physics
- taught 2023 and 2022

The aim of the lecture is to provide students with basic knowledge of the programming language C and its use in dealing with physical problems, such as numerical integration, solving differential equations and the Monte Carlo method for simulating physical processes.
