I am a physicist and a hardware development expert specialised in integration, testing and verificiation
of electronic systems.
I combine hands-on experience, acquired during my PhD and in industry as a certified
electrician, with academic knowledge gained during my studies in physics.

This website will eventually be filled with more content. For now checkout some of my coding repositories or my cv.
