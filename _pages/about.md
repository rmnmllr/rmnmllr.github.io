Masterâ€™s degree in Physics with a background as an certified electrician. I combine hands-on experience, acquired in the industry, with academic knowledge gained during my studies in particle physics. I started my PhD in experimental particle physics within the Bern ATLAS group in March 2020. I do hardware development for the ATLAS ITk Pixel data transmission chain and data analysis for a precision Standard Model measurement of di-lepton final states. Furthermore I am conducting a Leptoquark phenomenology study for ATLAS ITk.
